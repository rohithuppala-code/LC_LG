## 🏗️ Repository Architecture

This repository is structured in two progressive phases:

### 🔹 Phase 1: `cogniflow/` (LangChain Expression Language - LCEL)
- **Universal LLM Factory**: Hot-swappable providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Groq).
- **Structured Outputs**: Pydantic validation and schema extraction.
- **LCEL Architecture**: Declarative chains, `RunnablePassthrough`, `RunnableParallel`, and `RunnableLambda`.
- **Dynamic Tool Execution**: Tool bindings, duckduckgo search, and custom tools.
- **Conversational Memory**: State management and message history.

### 🔹 Phase 2: `nexus_agent/` (Autonomous Multi-Agent System with LangGraph)
- **State Machine Architecture**: Nodes, edges, conditional routing, and cycles.
- **Hierarchical Supervision**: Supervisor agent orchestrating specialized worker agents.
- **Durable Persistence**: SQLite/Postgres checkpointing and state time-travel.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: Interrupts and approval gates for critical actions.
- **Event Streaming**: Low-latency token streaming and graph execution telemetry.
